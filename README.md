# EarthSentinel: Landslide Detection using Deep Learning

EarthSentinel is an advanced deep learning project that utilizes Siamese Neural Networks to detect and monitor landslides using satellite imagery time series data. The system analyzes temporal changes in terrain to identify potential landslide events, focusing on the Himachal Pradesh region.

## 🌟 Features

- **Siamese Neural Network Architecture**: Employs a twin neural network approach to compare temporal satellite imagery
- **Multi-temporal Analysis**: Processes weekly satellite imagery stacks to detect terrain changes
- **Automated Patch Generation**: Creates and processes image patches for efficient training
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes trained models for immediate inference
- **Geographic Focus**: Specialized for Himachal Pradesh region with potential for adaptation to other areas
